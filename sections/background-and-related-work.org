Two of the main problems that have been of recent interest are solving the problems of route scheduling and charging
fleets as well as determining the infrastructure upon which they rely. In fact, the prospect of solving both problems
simultaneously has received much attention [cite:@wei-2018-optim-spatio;@sebastiani-2016-evaluat-elect;
@hoke-2014-accoun-lithium;@wang-2017-elect-vehic]. These problems vary by including assignment of buses to routes
[cite:@rinaldi-2020-mixed-fleet; @zhou-2020-collab-optim; @tang-2019-robus-sched; @li-2014-trans-bus], determining
whether a set of existing combustion based buses should be replaced with BEBs [cite:@zhou-2020-bi-objec;
@duan-2021-refor-mixed; @rinaldi-2020-mixed-fleet; @zhou-2020-collab-optim], and accounting for uncertainties
[cite:@bie-2021-optim-elect; @duan-2021-refor-mixed; @tang-2019-robus-sched;@ursavas-2016-optim-polic]. These problems
add additional complexities that warrant simplifications due to computational complexities.

Several simplifications are made throughout the literature to make these problems computationally feasible. These
simplifications to the charge scheduling model include utilizing only fast chargers while planning
[cite:@wei-2018-optim-spatio;@sebastiani-2016-evaluat-elect;@wang-2017-optim-rechar;@zhou-2020-bi-objec;
@yang-2018-charg-sched;@wang-2017-elect-vehic;@qin-2016-numer-analy;@liu-2020-batter-elect]. If slow chargers are used,
they are only deployed at the one location with fast chargers being deployed elsewhere
[cite:@he-2020-optim-charg;@tang-2019-robus-sched]. Some approaches also simplify by assuming a full charge is always
achieved [cite:@wei-2018-optim-spatio;@wang-2017-elect-vehic;@zhou-2020-bi-objec;@wang-2017-optim-rechar].

In some works, it was assumed that the charge received is proportional to the time spent on the charger
[cite:@liu-2020-batter-elect;@yang-2018-charg-sched]. While the linear battery dynamics is a valid assumption when the
battery SOC is below 80% [cite:@liu-2020-batter-elect], non-linear battery dynamics can be implemented to more accurately
model the charge curve. A common way to model the non-linear battery dynamics is utilizing Constant Voltage (CV),
Constant Current (CC), and Constant Current Constant Voltage (CCCV) [cite:@abdollahi-2016-optim-batter;
@chen-2008-desig-grey]. It has also been suggested that the dynamics can be modeled as a piecewise function containing a
linear and non-linear component from which a piecewise function approach may be taken for the CV and CC components
[cite:@zhang-2021-optim-elect;@abdollahi-2016-optim-batter]. Others have modeled the battery dynamics as a discrete
first order dynamics model [cite:@whitaker-2023-a-network]. The first-order differential system, when provided a step
input, approximates the non-linear relationship between time and the current SOC [cite:@whitaker-2023-a-network].

Works concerning charge planning often use a version of the vehicle scheduling problem [cite:@tang-2019-robus-sched;
@li-2014-trans-bus; @he-2020-optim-charg]. Variants of this problem address infrastructure as well as determining
existing buses that should be replaced by a BEB [cite:@zhou-2020-bi-objec; @duan-2021-refor-mixed;
@rinaldi-2020-mixed-fleet; @zhou-2020-collab-optim]. Other works introduce a directed graph approach to model the flow
of BEBs [cite:@whitaker-2023-a-network;@liu-2020-batter-elect], where this concept was expanded to simultaneously
accounting for multiple charger types, partial charging, non-linear battery charge profiles
[cite:@whitaker-2023-a-network]. The directed graph approach provides an easy method of modeling the scheduling by
discretizing the time horizon to $n_Q$ sets of nodes. The nodes represent the chargers availability and can have a
maximum of one bus at a time. The buses can flow into a node to be charged and then later can exit allowing a new bus to
enter. Another method similar to the directed graph that fits the modeling of the BEB charging scenario is the PAP
[cite:@qarebagh-2019-optim-sched]. The PAP is derived from the BAP which takes an input of vessel arrival times and
outputs the selection of the berthing quay. The PAP utilizes this model and redefines its inputs to EV arrival times and
outputs queues for the EVs to be charged. While the visits remain as discrete events, the time that the BEB is on the
charger is modeled in continuous time similar to [cite:@frojan-2015-contin-berth;
@qarebagh-2019-optim-sched;@zhou-2020-collab-optim]. Due to the close relationship between the BAP and PAP, BAP
literature may be used for the PAP. The literature shows methods of handling multiple quays (sets of chargers) to handle
general berthing scenarios [cite:@frojan-2015-contin-berth;@dai-2008-suppl-chain-analy]. Heuristic procedures for
quicker solve times have also been introduced [cite:@imai-2001-dynam-berth]. Methods of defining static (full time
horizon) and dynamic (rolling-time horizon) models have been created for daily and real-time solutions, respectively,
and even fuzzy set theory has been applied to allow for more flexible schedules [cite:@bello-2019-fuzzy-activ].

** Problem Description

:CUSTOM_ID: sec:problem-description
:END:

The work of this thesis builds upon the Position Allocation Problem (PAP) [cite:@qarebagh-2019-optim-sched], a
modification of the well studied Berth Allocation Problem (BAP), as a means to schedule the charging of electric
vehicles (EVs) [cite:@buhrkal-2011-model-discr;@frojan-2015-contin-berth;@imai-2001-dynam-berth]. The goal of the PAP is
to allocate incoming EVs into queues to be charged as depicted in \autoref{subfig:papexample}. An example of a standard
PAP/BAP solution (their visual representations are interchangeable) is visualized in \autoref{fig:bap}, note that the
figure utilized BAP terminology. The x and y-axis represent time and queuing space, respectively. The figure discretizes
the queuing space, but it may be continuous if desired. The shaded rectangles' widths represent their respective
allocated charge times, and their heights represent the physical space taken by each EV.

Adapting the PAP model for BEBs, consider a fleet of BEBs scheduled to perform a set of prescribed routes on a given
day. An individual BEB from said fleet begins and completes an individual route at the same station from which it also
receives its charge. During each route, the BEB's State of Charge (SOC) is depleted by a certain amount. The charge
supplied during its visit must be enough to sustain the BEB's SOC at an appropriate level so that it may complete its
next route. The charge may be supplied from any single charger given a set of chargers at the station. Let the term
"arrival" describe the time at which a BEB reaches the station. Furthermore, let the term "visit" denote a BEB having
arrived, awaited its predetermined time (whether it has received a charge or not), and departed from the station. Each
BEB may have multiple visits to the station throughout their working day. This paper describes a method to optimize the
assignment of each visit to a charger given a schedule for a fleet of BEBs that follow the behavior described above. The
various models presented in this work optimizes over peak power usage and energy consumption, as well as attempts to
optimize the amount of chargers utilized. Both linear and non-linear battery dynamics are introduced and implemented.

** Overview of the PAP
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:overview-of-the-pap
:END:

The BAP defines the foundation of the PAP; however, there are some differences in the way the variables are interpreted. For
the $i^{th}$ visit, starting service time is now the starting charge time, the berth location is now the charger queue
for assignment, and the service time is now the elapsed charge time. There are also a few clarifying concepts about how
the system is modeled. The PAP models the set of chargers as one continuous line; that is, the natural behavior of the
PAP model is to allow vehicles to be queued anywhere along the "charge strip" $[0,S]$. Similarly, the charge times are
continuous and can be placed anywhere on the time horizon, $[0,T]$, as long as the allocated times do not interfere with
other scheduled charge times.
