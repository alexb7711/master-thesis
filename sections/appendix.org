This section introduces an area of interest for future work. As far as the research for this thesis has shown, no other
work has provided robustness in their resulting charge schedule. This section introduces a sense of robustness into the
MILP model by allowing uncertainty in the arrival times of the BEBs. By “fuzzifying” the model, the “fuzzy” variables
are allowed to have upper and lower bounds for which the model can provide solutions for. The work to be introduced
promises much potential for further research and development in regard to scheduling BEBs. What follows is a proposal
for a Simulated Annealing (SA) implementation and extension of the PAP utilizing Fully Fuzzy Mixed Integer Linear
Programming (FFMILP) constraints with non-linear battery dynamics.

The Fuzzy PAP (FPAP) expands upon the MILP-PAP by adding a layer of robustness to the model's solutions
[cite:@bello-2019-fuzzy-activ; @kaur-2016-introd-fuzzy]. By introducing fuzziness to the model, that allows a sense of
uncertainty to some of the parameters. In a realistic scenario, multiple factors such as technical problems, weather
conditions, road detours, among others, buses may arrive earlier or later than anticipated to the station/depot. For
crisp models, there is no sense of lateness or earliness, thus the model's solutions lose validity at the moment that
any buses do not adhere to the route time perfectly. Fuzzifying the models in turn produces a fuzzy solution that
encodes ranges of times that buses may arrive while still remaining a valid solution.

The appendix proceeds as follows. \ref{sec:fuzzy-preliminaries} introduces some of the basic concepts of Mixed Integer
Linear Programming (MILP), fuzzy set theory, and Fully Fuzzy Linear Programming (FFLP). \ref{sec:the-fuzzy-bap}
introduces and derives a Fuzzy BAP (FBAP) model. \ref{sec:the-fuzzy-pap} then adapts the PAP into the FPAP by utilizing
the results from the previous sections.

This section introduces the concept of fuzzy set theory by providing some basic definitions. The theory is then built on to discuss Fully Fuzzy Linear Programming (FFLP). FFLP is a branch of Linear Programming where some of the parameters are allowed to have uncertainty which will be further elaborated on. In this section a method of constructing FFLP is introduced. Once the FFLP model has been introduced, a derivation of the Fuzzy BAP (FBAP) is introduced and discussed.
