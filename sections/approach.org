* APPROACH
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:approach
:END:

This section introduces the actions and formulations associated with the objectives described in [[#sec:objectives]]. The
actions shall be presented in the same order as [[#sec:objectives]] for consistency. Furthermore, as some of the research
proposed in this work has been completed, this section aims to identify complete and incomplete aspects of the research
as its being presented.

** Objective 1: Mathematically model the PAP to optimally assign BEBs to queues with unknown charging times to allow consideration of consumption cost and battery health
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:act-math-model-pap
:END:

This section addresses the actions by deriving a method of identifying buses for subsequent visits which is utilized to
formulate a way of estimating the SOC during the BEBs charging phase. The method introduced in this section demonstrates
the linear battery dynamics that have been implemented in the MILP-PAP. The derivation also demonstrates how the model
will discretize the queuing space to accommodate multiple types of chargers.

*** Task 1.1: Modify PAP to enable multiple visits by a BEB with variable charger duration per visit

:CUSTOM_ID: sec:app-modify-pap

*** Task 1.2: Incorporate heterogeneous charger capabilities into the PAP to model slow and fast charging, and minimize total charger count. Slow charging will be incentivized for battery health and consumption cost.
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:app-incorporate-pap
:END:

The kernel of this task was developed in [[#sec:queuing]]; however, some refinement on the formulation of some of the
decision variables is required. To encourage the MILP PAP problem to utilize the fewest number of chargers, the value of
$m_q$ in the objective function, \ref{eq:objective}, is to be defined as $\forall q \in \{0, 1, ..., n_B\}: m_q = 0$ and $\forall q \in
\{n_B+1, n_B+2, ..., n_B + n_C\}: m_q = 1000q$. That is, for each charging queue beyond the idle queues, $n_B$, increase
the cost of assignment by 1000. By minimizing the objective function, the result will tend toward the fewest number of
charging queues. Furthermore, if we allow the queue to be arranged with slow chargers first and fast chargers second,
then objective function will in addition favor slow chargers.

To account for the consumption cost, consider the charge duration scalar, $\epsilon_q$. If the input parameter is defined as
the charge rate, $\epsilon_q = r_q$, then the second term in \ref{eq:objective} defines the consumption cost over visit $i$,
$g_{iq}\epsilon_q$. By summing over all visits, the total consumption cost is determined. This metric is thus utilized as a
measure of the consumption cost as well as a mechanism to encourage the model to minimize active charger times,
particuarly for the fast chargers.

** Objective 2: Develop robust charger allocation capabilities to account for non-linear battery dynamics
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:act-math-model-robust
:END:

In this section, non-linear dynamics will be introduced with a brief description of the mathematical approach that will
be taken. The work presented in this section has yet to be completed.

*** Task 2.1: Incorporate non-linear battery dynamics into the FFLP PAP model
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:non-linear-battery-dynamics
:END:

Modeling the charging dynamics is imperative to the model's accuracy as it is one of the main factors in terms of the
decision variables. If the SOC is improperly modeled, that will produce an erroneous depiction of the state of BEB
charges and could result in over or under charging. Thus, care must be taken into considering the BEB's charging model.
There are various methods of modeling the SOC of a battery and can vary in complexity based on the attempt to
incorporate temperature, battery degradation, and current
[cite:@zhang-2021-optim-elect;@chen-2008-desig-grey;@watrin-2012-multip-lithium].

Some of the conventional methods to charge batteries are: Constant Voltage (CV), Constant Current (CC), and Constant
Current Constant Voltage (CCCV) [cite:@arabsalmanabadi-2018-charg-techn]. CCCV, as the name describes, is the
combination of CCCV model [cite:@abdollahi-2016-optim-batter; @chen-2008-desig-grey; @wang-2021-resear-optim]. In CCCV,
a constant current is applied to a battery until it reaches terminal voltage. At this point a constant voltage is
applied as the charge current decreases and the battery reaches full charge [cite:@chen-2008-desig-grey]. Thus, by
extension, CV merely applies a constant voltage and CC a constant current.

As previously stated, the SOC can be accurately modeled until the battery reaches a charge of about 80%
[cite:@liu-2020-batter-elect]. At this point the SOC becomes non-linear. Naturally, it has been suggested by
[cite:@zhang-2021-optim-elect] that the SOC can be broken down into a linear and non-linear component. A plot of the SOC
for a battery is shown in [[fig:soc-plot]] to demonstrate these components [cite:@zhang-2021-optim-elect].

#+caption: Illistration of non-linear charging profile.
#+attr_org: :width 500
#+attr_latex: :width 0.5\textwidth
[[file:../img/soc-plot.png]]

While some leverage the linear and non-linear components to derive their SOC model [cite:@abdollahi-2016-optim-batter],
others have derived a first order equation to model this behavior [cite:@whitaker-2023-a-network]. Assume that a charge
will occur over $dt$ seconds. The SOC on the time step $h+1$ for bus $i$ can be determined by the simple discrete first
order equation

#+begin_export latex
\begin{equation}
  \eta_{\xi_i} = \bar{a}_q \eta_i - \bar{b}_q \kappa_{\Xi_i}
\end{equation}
#+end_export

where

#+begin_export latex
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{cc}
  \bar{a}_q = e^{a_q dt} & \bar{b}_q = e^{a_q dt} - 1
\end{array}
\end{equation}
#+end_export

The equation is developed by using exact discretization [cite:@hespanha-2018-linear], and is proved in
[cite:@whitaker-2023-a-network]. In the same way as the linear dynamics, the $i^{\text{th}}$ visit's initial charge is
indicated by $\eta_i$, the identity of visit $i$ is $\eta_{\Xi_i}$, and the subsequent visit is indicated by $\eta_{\xi_i}$. Thus,
the propagation mechanics remain untouched while the underlying battery dynamics are more accurate.

** Minimize the monetary cost of charging the BEBs :noexport:
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:minimize-monetary-cost
:END:

This section discusses the actions associated with the objective to minimize the monetary cost of charging the BEBs. To
accomplish the task, an objective function is incrementally developed to introduce the components of the assignment and
power costs. The assignment cost encodes the minimization of the chargers and encouraged use of slow chargers, as
discussed in [[#sec:math-model-pap]]. The assignment cost also introduces the penalty function, for the objective in
[[#sec:obj-math-model-robust]], in an attempt to broaden the solution space of the MILP. The power cost component
encompasses the consumption and demand costs which will be derived. The method of more aggressively reducing demand cost
for peak hours is also introduced with the power cost component.

** Method And Validation
The proposed work is to be modeled and simulated using a SA approach written in the Rust programming language. Rust has
been chosen for its reliability with its ownership model, performance that is comparable to C/C++, and its Python-like
packaging system. SA was chosen as for its simplicity in implementation, and is one of the best known metaheuristic
methods for "addressing difficult black global optimization problems" [cite:@delahaye-2019-simul]. Note that the SA-PAP
implementation has begun. At the moment the main development that has been completed is: project structure/design,
implementation of the skeletal framework, code for importing route data, and some work has been done on the generating
functions. As previously stated, the MILP-PAP has been implemented and tested. Thus, the MILP-PAP shall be used as a
baseline measure to compare the results of the proposed work. An introduction to Simulated Annealing as well as the
proposed method of implementation will subsequently be outlined and discussed.

** Summary
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:approach-summary
:END:

The previous sections discussed the approaches to be taken (or have taken) for each respective objective along with a
derivation when available for the proposed approach. A projected project schedule was also provided. This research
intends to increase utility of the PAP by first modifying the model to allow BEBs' charges to be propagated, include an
identifier for BEBs to be tracked, utilize non-linear charging dynamics, as well as utilizing FFLP to develop a robust
solution. Upon completion, the proposed research will demonstrate its full utility and extensibility due to the MILP's
nature of adding additional constraints. This research project shall illustrate a robust BEB charging schedule with
realistic applicability.
