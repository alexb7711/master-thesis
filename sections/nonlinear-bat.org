** Non-linear Battery Dynamics Model

Modeling the charging dynamics is imperative to the model's accuracy as it is one of the main factors in terms of the
decision variables. If the SOC is improperly modeled, that will produce an erroneous depiction of the state of BEB
charges and could result in over or under charging. Thus, care must be taken into considering the BEB's charging model.
There are various methods of modeling the SOC of a battery and can vary in complexity based on the attempt to
incorporate temperature, battery degradation, and current
[cite:@zhang-2021-optim-elect;@chen-2008-desig-grey;@watrin-2012-multip-lithium].

Some of the conventional methods to charge batteries are: Constant Voltage (CV), Constant Current (CC), and Constant
Current Constant Voltage (CCCV) [cite:@arabsalmanabadi-2018-charg-techn]. CCCV, as the name describes, is the
combination of CCCV model [cite:@abdollahi-2016-optim-batter; @chen-2008-desig-grey; @wang-2021-resear-optim]. In CCCV,
a constant current is applied to a battery until it reaches terminal voltage. At this point a constant voltage is
applied as the charge current decreases and the battery reaches full charge [cite:@chen-2008-desig-grey]. Thus, by
extension, CV merely applies a constant voltage and CC a constant current.

As previously stated, the SOC can be accurately modeled until the battery reaches a charge of about 80%
[cite:@liu-2020-batter-elect]. At this point the SOC becomes non-linear. Naturally, it has been suggested by
[cite:@zhang-2021-optim-elect] that the SOC can be broken down into a linear and non-linear component. A plot of the SOC
for a battery is shown in [[fig:soc-plot]] to demonstrate these components [cite:@zhang-2021-optim-elect].

While some leverage the linear and non-linear components to derive their SOC model [cite:@abdollahi-2016-optim-batter],
others have derived a first order equation to model this behavior [cite:@whitaker-2023-a-network]. Assume that a charge
will occur over $dt$ seconds. The SOC on the time step $h+1$ for bus $i$ can be determined by the simple discrete first
order equation

#+begin_export latex
\begin{equation}
  \eta_{\xi_i} = \bar{a}_q \eta_i - \bar{b}_q \kappa_{\Xi_i}
\end{equation}
#+end_export

where

#+begin_export latex
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{cc}
  \bar{a}_q = e^{a_q dt} & \bar{b}_q = e^{a_q dt} - 1
\end{array}
\end{equation}
#+end_export

The equation is developed by using exact discretization [cite:@brogan-1990-moder-contr-theor], and is proved in
[cite:@whitaker-2023-a-network]. The lemma and proof are subsequently shown for completeness.

\begin{lemma}
Assume that the charge will occur over intervals over $\Delta$ seconds, the charge at time step $k+1$ for visit $i$ can be related to the charge at time step $k$ using charger $q$ as

\begin{equation}
\eta_{i,k+1} = \bar{a}_{q_i} \eta_{i,k} - \bar{b}_{q_i} M_i\text{,}
\end{equation}

where $\eta_{i, k+1}$ represents a discrete

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:nonlin-discrete-model}
\bar{a}_{q_i} = e^{a_{q_i} \Delta},\; \bar{b}_{q_i} = e^{a_{q_i} \Delta} - 1\text{.}
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
A first-order, continuous model converging to $M_j$ at an exponential rate of $a_{q_i}$ can be expressed as

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cont-exp}
\dot{s}_i = a_{q_i} \eta_i(t) - a_{q_i} M_i\text{.}
\end{equation}

The resulting discrete model in \ref{eq:nonlin-discrete-model} is obtained by using the exact discretation of an LTI system as is \cite{brogan-1990-moder-contr-theor}. Assuming $u(t)$ is held constant over the discrete step $\Delta$, the exact discretation of a general LTI system, represented as in $\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t)$, is given by

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:exact-disc}
\begin{array}{ll}
x_{k+1} = \bar{A}x_k + \bar{B}u_k & \\
\bar{A} = e^{A\Delta} \\
\bar{B} = \int_0^\Delta e^{A-\tau} d\tau B\text{.}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

In \ref{eq:cont-exp}, both $a_{q_i}$ and $M_i$ are constants with no actual control input. To utilize this general discretization formula, \ref{eq:cont-exp} is rewritten as $\dot{s}_i = a_{q_i} \eta_i(t) - b_{q_i}u(t)$ where $b_{q_i} = a_{q_i}$ and $u(t) = -M_i$. Viewing this new equation in reference to \ref{eq:exact-disc}, the state $x(t)$ is replaced with $\eta_i(t)$ and the matrices, $A$ and $B$, are replaced with $a_{q_i}$ and $b_{q_i}$, respectively. Performing these substitutions the discretized forms of $a_{q_i}$ and $b_{q_i}$ become

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
\bar{a}_{q_i} = e^{a_{q_i} \Delta} \\
\bar{b}_{q_i} = a_{q_i} \int_0^\Delta e^{a_{q_i}(\Delta - \tau)} d\tau\text{.}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

The integral in $\bar{b}_{q_i}$ can be solved analytically by taking the antiderivative as

\begin{equation}
\bar{b}_{q_i} = a_{q_i} \Big( \left. -\frac{1}{a_{q_i}} e^{a_{q_i} (\Delta - \tau)} \right|_{\tau = 0}^{\tau = \Delta}\Big) = e^{a_{q_i}\Delta} - 1\text{.}
\end{equation}
\end{proof}

Thus, a visit may leverage this model by taking the initial SOC, $\eta_i$, substituting $\Delta$ for the charge duration, $s_i$,
and letting $q_i$ represent the convergence rate, the accumulated charge over visit $i$ can be directly calculated using
the exact discretization defined above. \ref{fig:convergence-rates} depicts the charge profile estimation utilizing
different convergence rates. Note from the figure, the values for the rate of convergence are negative.
