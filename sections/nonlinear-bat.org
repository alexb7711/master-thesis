The models presented up to this point have employed linear battery dynamic models to estimate the SOC of the BEB during
its charging phase. While linear battery dynamics are accurate up to about an 80% SOC [cite:@liu-2020-batter-elect],
fidelity is lost after this point due to the non-linearity of the charge profile. This chapter introduces a method of
replacing the linear battery dynamics throughout this work with a non-linear dynamics model. The non-linear model will
be employed in the SA algorithm from [[#sec:sa-pap]]. The chapter proceeds as follows: an introduction to the non-linear
battery dynamics model is shown in [[#sec:nonlinear-model]] along with a proof and description of how the model is
incorporated. [[#sec:nonlinear-results]] presents and discusses the results.

** Non-linear Battery Dynamics Model

Modeling the charging dynamics is imperative to the model's accuracy as it is one of the main factors in terms of the
decision variables. If the SOC is improperly modeled, that will produce an erroneous depiction of the state of BEB
charges and could result in over or under charging. Thus, care must be taken into considering the BEB's charging model.
There are various methods of modeling the SOC of a battery and can vary in complexity based on the attempt to
incorporate temperature, battery degradation, and current
[cite:@zhang-2021-optim-elect;@chen-2008-desig-grey;@watrin-2012-multip-lithium].

Some of the conventional methods to charge batteries are: Constant Voltage (CV), Constant Current (CC), and Constant
Current Constant Voltage (CCCV) [cite:@arabsalmanabadi-2018-charg-techn]. In CCCV, a constant current is applied to a
battery until it reaches terminal voltage. Once this point has been reached, a constant voltage is applied as the charge
current decreases and the battery reaches full charge [cite:@chen-2008-desig-grey]. Thus, by extension, CV merely
applies a constant voltage and CC a constant current [cite:@arabsalmanabadi-2018-charg-techn].

As previously stated, the SOC can be accurately modeled until the battery reaches a charge of about 80%
[cite:@liu-2020-batter-elect]. At this point the SOC becomes non-linear. Naturally, it has been suggested by
[cite:@zhang-2021-optim-elect] that the SOC can be broken down into a linear and non-linear component. A plot of the SOC
for a battery is shown in [[fig:soc-plot]] to demonstrate these components [cite:@zhang-2021-optim-elect].

While some leverage the linear and non-linear components to derive their SOC model [cite:@abdollahi-2016-optim-batter],
others have derived a first order equation to model this behavior [cite:@whitaker-2023-a-network]. Assume that a charge
will occur over $dt$ seconds. The SOC on the time step $h+1$ for bus $i$ can be determined by the simple discrete first
order equation

#+begin_export latex
\begin{equation}
  \eta_{\xi_i} = \bar{a}_q \eta_i - \bar{b}_q \kappa_{\Xi_i}\text{,}
\end{equation}
#+end_export

where

#+begin_export latex
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{cc}
  \bar{a}_q = e^{a_q dt} & \bar{b}_q = e^{a_q dt} - 1\text{.}
\end{array}
\end{equation}
#+end_export

The equation is developed by using exact discretization [cite:@brogan-1990-moder-contr-theor], and is proved in
[cite:@whitaker-2023-a-network]. The lemma and proof are subsequently shown for completeness.

\begin{lemma}
Assume that the charge will occur over intervals over $\Delta$ seconds, the charge at time step $k+1$ for visit $i$ can be related to the charge at time step $k$ using charger $q$ as

\begin{equation}
\eta_{i,k+1} = \bar{a}_{q_i} \eta_{i,k} - \bar{b}_{q_i} M_i\text{,}
\end{equation}

where $\eta_{i, k}$ represents the SOC for bus $i$ at step $k$ and

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:nonlin-discrete-model}
\bar{a}_{q_i} = e^{a_{q_i} \Delta},\; \bar{b}_{q_i} = e^{a_{q_i} \Delta} - 1\text{.}
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
A first-order, continuous model converging to $M_j$ at an exponential rate of $a_{q_i}$ can be expressed as

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cont-exp}
\dot{s}_i = a_{q_i} \eta_i(t) - a_{q_i} M_i\text{.}
\end{equation}

The resulting discrete model in \ref{eq:nonlin-discrete-model} is obtained by using the exact discretation of an LTI system as is \cite{brogan-1990-moder-contr-theor}. Assuming $u(t)$ is held constant over the discrete step $\Delta$, the exact discretation of a general LTI system, represented as in $\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t)$, is given by

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:exact-disc}
\begin{array}{ll}
x_{k+1} = \bar{A}x_k + \bar{B}u_k & \\
\bar{A} = e^{A\Delta} \\
\bar{B} = \int_0^\Delta e^{A-\tau} d\tau B\text{.}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

In \ref{eq:cont-exp}, both $a_{q_i}$ and $M_i$ are constants with no actual control input. To utilize this general discretization formula, \ref{eq:cont-exp} is rewritten as $\dot{s}_i = a_{q_i} \eta_i(t) - b_{q_i}u(t)$ where $b_{q_i} = a_{q_i}$ and $u(t) = -M_i$. Viewing this new equation in reference to \ref{eq:exact-disc}, the state $x(t)$ is replaced with $\eta_i(t)$ and the matrices, $A$ and $B$, are replaced with $a_{q_i}$ and $b_{q_i}$, respectively. Performing these substitutions the discretized forms of $a_{q_i}$ and $b_{q_i}$ become

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
\bar{a}_{q_i} = e^{a_{q_i} \Delta} \\
\bar{b}_{q_i} = a_{q_i} \int_0^\Delta e^{a_{q_i}(\Delta - \tau)} d\tau\text{.}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

The integral in $\bar{b}_{q_i}$ can be solved analytically by taking the antiderivative as

\begin{equation}
\bar{b}_{q_i} = a_{q_i} \Big( \left. -\frac{1}{a_{q_i}} e^{a_{q_i} (\Delta - \tau)} \right|_{\tau = 0}^{\tau = \Delta}\Big) = e^{a_{q_i}\Delta} - 1\text{.}
\end{equation}
\end{proof}

Thus, a visit may leverage this model by taking the initial SOC, $\eta_i$, substituting $\Delta$ for the charge duration, $s_i$,
and letting $q_i$ represent the convergence rate, the accumulated charge over visit $i$ can be directly calculated using
the exact discretization defined above. \ref{fig:convergence-rates} depicts the charge profile estimation utilizing
different convergence rates. Note from the figure, the values for the rate of convergence are negative.

** Results

The following results are generated utilizing the same parameters and problem setup as [[#sec:sa-pap-example]]. To
approximate the linear charge speeds, the convergence rate for each charger type was adjusted such that the non-linear
charge curve intersected the respective linear charge profile at the 80% SOC mark (i.e. the linear portion of the SOC
charge profile). It was found that convergence rates of 0.002 and 0.000045 for fast and slow chargers, respectively,
intersected their linear counterparts at 80% SOC as shown in [[fig:nonlinear-linear-match]]. Furthermore, the heuristic
technique was executed utilizing the non-linear battery dynamics. The BPAP and linear heuristic SA plots are included as
comparisons against the presented non-linear SA technique. Note that the BPAP and heuristic schedules are generated
utilizing linear battery dynamics.

\ref{subfig:schedule-nonlinear-sa} depicts the charge schedule generated utilizing non-linear battery dynamics.
Similarly to before, the symbol represents the point at which a BEB begins charging. The horizontal line with vertical
tic indicate the time over which said BEB receives its charge. Idle chargers were removed for the sake of legibility and
space, therefore rows 0-14 of \ref{fig:nonlinear-schedule} represent the slow charging queues and rows 15-29 represent
the fast charging queues. The non-linear schedule utilized a total of nine slow charging queues and one fast charger. It
is of note that schedules generated are of a similar structure. However, the charge times for the fast chargers are of
longer durations due to the non-linear charge profile. That is, the rate at which the non-linear battery dynamics model
accepts additional charge at SOCs above 80% is much lower than that of the linear battery dynamics, causing longer
charge times.

#+include: ../tab/nonlinear-charge.org

\ref{tab:nonlinear-charge} tabulates the mean and max demand SOC for each. The mean SOC for both the linear and
non-linear heuristic SA techniques were approximately the same, but the minimum SOC for the non-linear heuristic SA is
lower than that of the linear. This is again due to the non-linear charge profile and the fact that the minimum SOC
constraint is soft. This issue may be remedied by including a safety factor term to artificially elevate the minimum SOC
threshold, $S_{f}\nu_i \kappa_i$ where $S_{f} > 1;\; S_f \in \mathbb{R}$.

#+include: ../tab/nonlinear-power.org

\ref{fig:power-usage-nonlinear-sa} plots the power usage over the time horizon and \ref{tab:nonlinear-power} tabulates
the mean and max demand for each. The BPAP and linear SA techniques maintain the lowest mean power demand. This is
expected due to the longer charge durations required by the non-linear battery dynamics to reach the same SOC as the
linear. However, it is vital to note that even with the non-linear charge profile, the peak demand was still below that
of the BPAP and only 30 kW more than the linear SA. That is, even due to the longer charge durations, the schedule was
still able to successfully minimize the power demand.

The consumed energy by each schedule is shown in \ref{fig:energy-usage-nonlinear-sa}. The ordering of most energy
consumed to least is as follows: non-linear SA, linear SA, and the BPAP with the respective energy consumption for each
being \num{5919.230} kWh, \num{4295.660} kWh, and \num{4237.200} kWh. The non-linear SA consumed about \num{1163.07} kWh
more than the BPAP. The energy consumed is considerably higher again due to the non-linear charge profile.
