** Non-linear Battery Dynamics Model

:CUSTOM_ID: sec:model
:END:

Modeling the charging dynamics is imperative to the model's accuracy as it is one of the main factors in terms of the
decision variables. If the SOC is improperly modeled, that will produce an erroneous depiction of the state of BEB
charges and could result in over or under charging. Thus, care must be taken into considering the BEB's charging model.
There are various methods of modeling the SOC of a battery and can vary in complexity based on the attempt to
incorporate temperature, battery degradation, and current
[cite:@zhang-2021-optim-elect;@chen-2008-desig-grey;@watrin-2012-multip-lithium].

Some of the conventional methods to charge batteries are: Constant Voltage (CV), Constant Current (CC), and Constant
Current Constant Voltage (CCCV) [cite:@arabsalmanabadi-2018-charg-techn]. CCCV, as the name describes, is the
combination of CCCV model [cite:@abdollahi-2016-optim-batter; @chen-2008-desig-grey; @wang-2021-resear-optim]. In CCCV,
a constant current is applied to a battery until it reaches terminal voltage. At this point a constant voltage is
applied as the charge current decreases and the battery reaches full charge [cite:@chen-2008-desig-grey]. Thus, by
extension, CV merely applies a constant voltage and CC a constant current.

As previously stated, the SOC can be accurately modeled until the battery reaches a charge of about 80%
[cite:@liu-2020-batter-elect]. At this point the SOC becomes non-linear. Naturally, it has been suggested by
[cite:@zhang-2021-optim-elect] that the SOC can be broken down into a linear and non-linear component. A plot of the SOC
for a battery is shown in [[fig:soc-plot]] to demonstrate these components [cite:@zhang-2021-optim-elect].

While some leverage the linear and non-linear components to derive their SOC model [cite:@abdollahi-2016-optim-batter],
others have derived a first order equation to model this behavior [cite:@whitaker-2023-a-network]. Assume that a charge
will occur over $dt$ seconds. The SOC on the time step $h+1$ for bus $i$ can be determined by the simple discrete first
order equation

#+begin_export latex
\begin{equation}
  \eta_{\xi_i} = \bar{a}_q \eta_i - \bar{b}_q \kappa_{\Xi_i}
\end{equation}
#+end_export

where

#+begin_export latex
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{cc}
  \bar{a}_q = e^{a_q dt} & \bar{b}_q = e^{a_q dt} - 1
\end{array}
\end{equation}
#+end_export

The equation is developed by using exact discretization [cite:@hespanha-2018-linear], and is proved in
[cite:@whitaker-2023-a-network]. In the same way as the linear dynamics, the $i^{\text{th}}$ visit's initial charge is
indicated by $\eta_i$, the identity of visit $i$ is $\eta_{\Xi_i}$, and the subsequent visit is indicated by $\eta_{\xi_i}$. Thus,
the propagation mechanics remain untouched while the underlying battery dynamics are more accurate.
