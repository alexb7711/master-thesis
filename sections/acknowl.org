\begin{acknowledgments}
I wish to express my sincere gratitude to Dr. Greg Droge, my major professor, for the countless hours of reflecting, reading, encouraging, and, most of all, patience throughout the years. I thank you for the freedom that you provided to conduct my research while maintaining a guiding hand. Similarly, I wish to thank those from my committee, Dr. Jacob Gunther and Dr. Burak Sarsilmaz.
