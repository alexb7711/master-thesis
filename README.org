* Components Of Topics
The following is a list of desired items to be included in the proposal.

- Position Allocation Problem (PAP) formulation
  - Built on from the Berth Allocation Problem (BAP)
  - Expand the formulation to not require information about the processing times
- Include Consumption/demand cost in the objective
  - Minimize the monetary cost of system by attempting to avoid peak hours
  - Minimize the monetary cost of system by reducing the peak15 of the system
- Nonlinear battery dynamics
  - More accurately predict the charging and discharging dynamics of LIBs
- Fuzzy solution the LP
  - Let the solution vary. Why have a rigorous plan in an uncertain world?
- Minimize chargers
  - Be able to predict what type of system setup is required for a set of routes
- Penalty method to allow for the bus to go below charge percentage
  - Having the charge be strictly above a certain percentage makes the solution space too small at times. This will allow the charges to vary more without killing the solver
- Simulated Annealing (SA) implementation
  - Pseudo code for the implementation
  - Written in rust (🦀)
